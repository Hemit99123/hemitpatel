    flagIndia: "The Indian flag represents my cultural identity.  This flag is not a nation to me but rather the blood of my ancestors. The blood that they shedded in gaining independence.",

    avro: "Aviation has always fascinated me. The Avro Arrow represents Canadian innovation that inspired my engineering studies. I built model airplanes as a child, dreaming of designing my own someday.\n\nMy aerospace professor shared the Arrow's story—a marvel of engineering canceled before reaching its potential. It became a powerful metaphor during my thesis project when funding was cut. Rather than abandoning my work, I found alternative approaches, determined not to let my 'Arrow' meet the same fate. The resilience I developed through that experience has served me well in my career, reminding me that technical excellence sometimes needs to be paired with strategic persistence.",
    totemPole: "Learning about Indigenous Canadian art opened my eyes to storytelling through symbols. This totem pole reminds me that my own life story is connected to ancestors and community.\n\nDuring a cultural exchange program, I was invited to witness a totem raising ceremony. The elder explained how each figure represented not just characters but relationships—between humans, animals, and the natural world. It fundamentally changed how I think about identity. I realized that who I am isn't just about personal achievement but about my connections to family, mentors, and even strangers who've shaped my path. The vertical nature of the pole reminds me that these connections span generations.",
    cnTower: "The most iconic symbol of Canadian natioanlity. It represents the innovation that Canadians can bring when they work together. It is a symbol of hope that unites everyone regardless of their origins!"
